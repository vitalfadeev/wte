==English==
{{wikipedia}}

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|en|doe}}

===Etymology 1===
{{PIE root|en|dʰeh₁}}
From {{inh|en|enm|don}}, from {{inh|en|ang|dōn}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dōną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-||to put, place, do, make}}.

The past tense form is from {{inh|en|enm|didde}}, {{m|enm|dude}}, from {{inh|en|ang|dyde}}, {{m|ang|*diede}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*dedǭ}}/{{m|gem-pro|*dedē}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*dʰédʰeh₁ti}}, an athematic e-reduplicated verb of the same root {{m|ine-pro|*dʰeh₁-}}.

The use of ''do'' in interrogative, negative, and, formerly, affirmative sentences, unusual in Germanic languages, is thought to be calqued from Brythonic.<ref>{{cite-book|author=John McWhorter|chapter=1|editor=|editors=|title=Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The Untold History of English

=====Conjugation=====
{{en-conj|do|did|done|doing|does}}

=====Usage notes=====
* In older forms of English, when the pronoun {{m|en|thou}} was in active use, and verbs used {{m|en|-est}} for distinct second-person singular indicative forms, the verb {{m|en||do}} had two such forms: {{m|en|dost}}, in auxiliary uses, and {{m|en|doest}}, in other uses. The past tense of both forms is {{m|en|didst}}.
* Similarly, when the ending {{m|en|-eth}} was in active use for third-person singular present indicative forms, the form {{m|en|doth}} was used as an auxiliary, and the form {{m|en|doeth}} elsewhere.

=====Antonyms=====
* {{l|en|don't}}

===Etymology===
{{PIE root|la|deh₃}}
From {{inh|la|itc-pro|*didō}}, from {{inh|la|ine-pro|*dédeh₃ti}}, from the root {{m|ine-pro|*deh₃-||give}}. The reduplication was lost in Latin in the present tense, but is preserved in the other Italic languages. A root aorist (from {{cog|ine-pro|*déh₃t}}) is preserved in Venetic {{m|xve|tr=doto}}; the other Italic perfect forms reflect a reduplicated stative, {{m|itc-pro|*dedai}}. However, the root aorist possibly served as the source of the Latin present forms.<ref>{{R:De Vaan 2008}}</ref>

Cognates include Ancient Greek {{m|grc|δίδωμι}}, Sanskrit {{m|sa|ददाति|tr=dádāti}}, Old Persian {{m|peo|sc=Xpeo|𐎭𐎭𐎠𐎬𐎢𐎺|tr=dā-}}.
